# Parametric Craig-Bampton Model Order Reduction  
A short self-initiated demo project

## What this shows
- Full-order flexible beam (5 m / 8 m / 10 m) in Abaqus  
- Export of mass & stiffness matrices  
- Craig-Bampton reduction to ~21 DOFs 
- Real-time dynamic simulation under gravity (FFRF)
- Fully parametric in boom length
